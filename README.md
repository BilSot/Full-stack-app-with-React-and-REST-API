This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Full Stack App with React and a REST API

For this project, with the use of React for the front-end, a client is implemented for an existing school database REST API (part of the project REST-API-with-Express). The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

### Technologies used:
- JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application
- React Router to set up the routes
- Use the Fetch API to fetch data from the REST API
- Basic authentication to support users signing in
